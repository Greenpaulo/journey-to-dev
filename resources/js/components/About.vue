    <p class="lead py-2">As a self taught developer I spent a lot of time, in the beginning, trying to figure out what to learn! Unlike a university course, there existed no curriculum for self-studying devs at home. So after spending time researching I built my own.</p>

    <p class="lead py-2">I realised that many other prospective developers could potentially benefit from my research and get straight to learning. So I built this app to share my knowledge. I hope you find it useful!</p>

    <p class="lead py-2">Much love! And good luck with your studies!</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Credit</h4>
    <p class="lead py-2">The Stages for this curriculum are based on Brad Traversy's yearly youtube video. Brad is a great teacher and I highly recommend his channel!</p>
